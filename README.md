# Employee-Presence-Insight-Dashboard
‚úÖ Project Title:
**Employee Presence Insight Dashboard**
üõ† Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI Desktop
Power Query for data cleaning & transformation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated columns & measures
Data Modeling to define relationships
Visualizations: Cards, bar charts, column charts, pie charts, and slicers

üìà Objective of the Dashboard:
To help HR teams monitor and analyze employee attendance trends, late coming patterns, absenteeism, and working hours. The dashboard provides actionable insights to improve workforce management.

‚öôÔ∏è Process & Steps to Build the Dashboard:
<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Dataset
Explored data provided (Excel/CSV): employee attendance records, shifts, departments, and timestamps.
Identified key fields: Employee ID, Date, In Time, Out Time, Department, Gender, etc.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning (Power Query)
Removed duplicates and fixed null or incorrect entries.
Converted date & time columns into proper formats.
Created new columns for Month, Day of Week, etc. to help with trend analysis.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling
Defined relationships between tables if multiple tables were used (e.g., Employee master data, attendance logs).
Ensured star schema design to optimize performance.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Measures (DAX)
Total Present Days
Total Absent Days
Late Arrivals count
Average Working Hours
Attendance Percentage

5Ô∏è‚É£ Building Visuals
Cards: Show KPIs like overall attendance rate, number of late comers.
Column/Bar Charts: Attendance trends by month, department, and gender.
Pie Chart: Distribution by department or shift.
Slicers: Allow HR to filter data dynamically by gender, department, shift, or month.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancing Interactivity
Used bookmarks & slicers for drill-down analysis.
Formatted visuals to ensure clarity and consistent styling.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Storytelling
Highlighted key findings (e.g., which department has the highest absenteeism).
Provided HR with actionable data to investigate and improve policies.
üìç Key Insights from Dashboard:
Trend of late arrivals by department and month.
Average working hours per department.
Attendance rate comparison between genders.
Identification of departments with the highest absenteeism.

üìå Project Source:
The dataset and problem statement were provided by Codebasics to simulate a real-world HR reporting scenario.
